\section{Overview}

For our project, we will be creating an FPGA adaptation of the memory-based game ``Simon." A sequence of LED's will flash in a particular order, after which the player will be expected to repeat the sequence by flipping the corresponding switched in the same order.

\section{Design Description}

At the very beginning the user will choose which difficulty to play the game at by setting a switch either up or down (corresponding to easy or difficult). Gameplay begins as follows: A single LED will flash along with a corresponding sound, and the user will flip the switch below this LED up and down. In each subsequent round, the number of LED's sequentially illuminated will increment by 1, thereby increasingly the difficulty of the task.\\

In the $i$th round, the sequence of the first $i-1$ flashes will be identical to those in the previous round, and the position of the $i$th flashing LED will be randomly generated.\\

Throughout gameplay, the 7-segment display will show the user's current score. Time permitting, the display will present fun messages to the player. Given that the display can only present 4 characters at a time, the aforementioned text may scroll to present longer messages to the player.

\section{Design Milestones and Grading Rubrics}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c | p{5.22cm}}
& \textbf{Percentage} & \textbf{Full Credit}\\\hline
\textbf{Sequence Generation}  & 12\% & Game generates a random sequence of LED's.\\\hline
\textbf{User Input}  &  12\% & Game differentiates between correct and incorrect user input and deals with each appropriately.\\\hline
\textbf{Score Output} &  11\% & At the end of each level, the game outputs the player's current score. At the end of the game, the game outputs the player's final score.\\\hline
\textbf{Reset} &  5\% & Pressing `Reset' starts the game over.\\\hline
\textbf{Sound} & 30\% & Along with lighting the expected LED, the game also emits a sound that corresponds with the LED to assist the player's memory.\\\hline
\textbf{Difficulty Levels} & 30\% & Player's can choose to play the game in easy or hard mode, the difference being the speed at which the game displays the sequence.\\\hline
