\section{Introduction}

In this lab, we implemented an FPGA adaptation of the memory game, "Simon". A sequence of LED's flashes in a particular order, after which the player inputs the sequence in the same order using the FPGA's switches. If successful, the user goes onto the next level which displays the same sequence of LEDs along with an additional, new random LED. \\

Additionally during the game, the seven segment display shows the current level that the user is on. The user can also play the game in a harder (faster) mode by flipping the difficulty switch.
